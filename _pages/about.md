I'm a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href='https://mhahn.info/'>Michael Hahn</a>. I recently completed my PhD in the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. I've also studied at McGill and Potsdam, worked as a researcher at Microsoft and Harvard, and founded a computational linguistics engineering team in the language-learning startup Babbel. 

I'm a computational linguist with psycholinguistic training and broad interests in language and cognition. My research combines computational modeling and behavioral experiments to address fundamental scientific questions about how human language is structured and processed. I focus particularly on <i>generalization</i> and how it works in inflectional morphology.

I recently led a survey with Paul Smolensky and colleagues at Microsoft Research to see what researchers think about compositionality in neural network models. Data collection is complete, but you can still <a href="https://kmccurdy.github.io/CBsurvey/">take the survey yourself</a> and <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.524">check our paper</a> to see how your views fit with the field as a whole!

<!--- how humans manage the trade-off between predictability and variation in language processing, and how this can be computationally modeled. My particular focus is on speaker generalization in lower-level linguistic domains (e.g. prosody, inflectional morphology), and how these phenomena interact with higher-level syntactic and semantic processing.
