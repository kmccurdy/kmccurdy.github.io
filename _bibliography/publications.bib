	title = {Implicit prosody and contextual bias in silent reading},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Eye-movement research on implicit prosody has found effects of lexical stress on syn- tactic ambiguity resolution, suggesting that metrical well-formedness constraints in- teract with syntactic category assignment. Building on these findings, the present eyetracking study investigates whether contextual bias can modulate the effects of metrical structure on syntactic ambiguity resolution in silent reading. Contextual bias and potential stress-clash in the ambiguous region were crossed in a 2 × 2 design. Participants read biased context sentences followed by temporarily ambiguous test sentences. In the three-word ambiguous region, main effects of lexical stress were dominant, while early effects of context were absent. Potential stress clash yielded a significant increase in first-pass regressions and re-reading probability across the three words. In the disambiguating region, the disambiguating word itself showed increased processing difficulty (lower skipping and increased re-reading probability) when the disambiguation engendered a stress clash configuration, while the word immediately following showed main effects of context in those same measures. Taken together, effects of lexical stress upon eye movements were swift and pervasive across first-pass and second-pass measures, while effects of context were relatively delayed. These results indicate a strong role for implicit meter in guiding parsing, one that appears insensitive to higher-level constraints. Our findings are problematic for two classes of models, the two-stage garden-path model and the constraint-based competition-integration model, but can be explained by a variation on the two-stage model, the unrestricted race model.},

	title = {Poetic rhyme reflects cross-linguistic differences in information structure},
	volume = {117},
	abstract = {Identical rhymes (right/write) are considered satisfactory and even artistic in French poetry but are considered unsatisfactory in English. This has been a con- sistent generalization over the course of centuries, a surprising fact given that other aspects of poetic form in French were happily applied in English. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that this difference is not merely one of poetic tradition, but is grounded in the distinct ways in which information-structure affects prosody in the two languages. A study of rhyme usage in poetry and a perception experi- ment confirm that native speakers’ intuitions about rhyming in the two languages indeed differ, and a further perception experiment supports the hypothesis that this 
fact is due to a constraint on prosody that is active in English but not in French. The findings suggest that certain forms of artistic expression in poetry are influenced, and even constrained, by more general properties of a language.},

	abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that vector space models of semantics can reﬂect undesirable biases in human culture. Our investigation of crosslinguistic word embeddings reveals that topical gender bias interacts with, and is surpassed in magnitude by, the effect of grammatical gender associations, and both may be attenuated by corpus lemmatization. This ﬁnding has implications for downstream applications such as machine translation.},

	abstract = {Prior research has shown that, under certain conditions, Human-Agent (H-A) alignment exists to a stronger degree than that found in Human-Human (H-H) communication. In an H-H Second Language (L2) setting, evidence of alignment has been linked to learning and teaching strategy. We present a novel analysis of H-A and H-H L2 learner dialogues using automated metrics of alignment. Our contributions are twofold: ﬁrstly we replicated the reported H-A alignment within an educational context, ﬁnding L2 students align to an automated tutor. Secondly, we performed an exploratory comparison of the alignment present in comparable H-A and H-H L2 learner corpora using Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), ﬁnding preliminary evidence that students in H-A L2 dialogues showed greater variability in engagement.},
